This script is to reorganise the output of the Tissue analyser data.
This script was used in the paper: "Multiciliated cells use filopodia to probe tissue mechanics during epithelial integration in vivo‚Äù by Ventura & Amiri et al., XXX., XXX.


How to use this script:

** This script requires two files as input: "bond_data.csv" & "cell_data.csv", obtained from Tissue analyzer. 
** Place the files with "exactly these names" in the same folder as the script. 
** Then open and run the script. 
** Wait until the file "cell_data_modified.csv" is generated, and the matlab window displays "Finished !". 
** "cell_data_modified.csv" contains the reorganised normalised myosin intensity data.
